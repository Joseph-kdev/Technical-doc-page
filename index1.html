            <p>
                JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.
            </p>
            <p>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. 
                But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a
                 new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.</p>
            <p>But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own
                 specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.</p>
            <p>Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level 
                access to memory or the CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.</p>
            <p>Some of the things it can do are:<ul>
                <li>Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.</li>
                <li>React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.</li>
                <li>Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.</li>
                <li>Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).</li>
                <li>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).</li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access 
                to OS functions.</p>
            <p>JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from 
                other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.</p>
              <p>JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as well.</p>
            <p>Today, JavaScript has a unique position as the most widely-adopted browser language, fully integrated with HTML/CSS.</p>
                <p>The ECMA-262 specification contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language.</p>
                <p>MDN (Mozilla) JavaScript Reference is the main manual with examples and other information. It’s great to get in-depth information about individual language functions, methods etc.
                    You can find it at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference.</p>

                <li><p>You require a good working environment to run scripts is the browser.</p></li>
                <li><p>You can use browser-specific commands to achieve for example using alert.</p></li>
                <li><p>To attach a script to HTML document we use the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag</p></li>
                <li><P>For instance:</P></li></ul>
                <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt; <br>
&lt;html&gt; <br>
<br>
&lt;body&gt; <br>
<br>
  &lt;p&gt;Before the script...&lt;/p&gt; <br>
  <br>
  &lt;script&gt; <br>
    alert( 'Hello, world!' ); <br>
  &lt;/script&gt; <br>
  <br>
  &lt;p&gt;...After the script.&lt;/p&gt; <br>
  <br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/html&gt; <br>
                </code>
                <p>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag contains JavaScript code which is automatically executed 
                    when the browser processes the tag.</p>
                <p>If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.</p>
                <p>Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute:</p>
                <code>&lt;script src="/path/to/script/js"&gt;</code>\
                <p>Here, <code>/path/to/script.js</code> is an absolute path to the script from the site root. </p>
                <p>One can also provide a relative path from the current page. For instance, <code>src="script.js"</code>, just 
                    like <code>src="./script.js"</code>, would mean a file <code>"script.js"</code> in the current folder.</p>
                <p>To attach several scripts, use multiple tags:</p> 
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;script src="/js/script1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; <br>
                        &lt;script src="/js/script2.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                    </code>
                </p>

                        <li>We can use a &lt;script&gt; tag to add JavaScript code to a page.</li>
                        <li>The type and language attributes are not required.</li>

            <article><ul>
              <p>The first thing to learn are the building blocks of code</p>
              <li><h4>Statements</h4></li>
              <p>Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.</p>
              <p>We've already seen a statement,<code>alert('Hello, world!')</code>, which shows the message “Hello, world!”.</p>
              <p>We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.</p>
              <p>For example, here we split “Hello World” into two alerts:</p><br>
              <code>alert('Hello'); alert('World');</code><br>
              <p>Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code more readable:</p>
              <code>alert('Hello'); <br> alert('World');</code>
              <li><h5>Semicolons</h5></li>
              <p>A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists.</p>
              <p>This would also work:</p>
              <code>alert('Hello') <br> alert('World')</code>
              <p>Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.</p>
              <p>it is recommended to put semicolons between statements even if they are separated by newlines.</p>
              <li><h5>Comments</h5></li>
              <p>As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and why.
                Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don't affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.
                One-line comments start with two forward slash characters //.For example:
              </p>
              <code>// This comment occupies a line of its own <br> alert('Hello');</code>
              <p>Multiline comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk /* and end with an asterisk and a forward slash */.For example:</p>
              <code>/* An example with two messages.
                This is a multiline comment.
                */ <br>
                alert('Hello'); <br>
                alert('World');</code>
                <p>Sometimes it can be handy to temporarily disable a part of code:</p>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
              </ul>

            <header><h2>Variables</h2></header>
            <article>
              <p>Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>An online shop - the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.</li>
                <li>A chat application - the information might include users, messages, and much more.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Variables are used to store this information.</p>
              <ul>
                <h5>A variable</h5>
                <li><p>This is a "named storage” for data.To create a variable in JavaScript, use the <code> let </code> keyword.</p></li>
                <li><p>The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:</p></li>
                <p><code> let message; </code></p>
                <li><p>Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:</p></li>
                <p><code>let message; <br>
                  message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message</code></p>
              <li><p>The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:</p></li>
              <p><code>let message;<br>
                message = 'Hello!';<br>
                alert(message); // shows the variable content</code></p>
                <p>To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:</p>
                <p><code>let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value <br>
                  alert(message); // Hello!
                  </code></p>
                <p>We can also declare multiple variables in one line:</p>
                <p><code>let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';</code></p>
                <p>That might seem shorter, but we don't recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.</p>
              </ul>
            </article>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header><h2>Constants</h2></header>
            <article>
              <p>To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:</p>
              <code>const myBirthday = '18.04.1982';</code> <br>
              <p>Variables declared using const are called “constants”. They cannot be reassigned. 
                An attempt to do so would cause an error:</p>
                <code>const myBirthday = '18.04.1982'; <br>
                  myBirthday = '01.01.2001'; // error, can't reassign the constant!</code> 
              <p>When a programmer is sure that a variable will never change, they can declare it with 
                const to guarantee and clearly communicate that fact to everyone.</p>
              <h4>Uppercase Constants</h4>
              <p>There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember 
                values that are known prior to execution.</p>
              <p>Such constants are named using capital letters and underscores.</p>
              <p>For instance, let's make constants for colors in so-called “web” (hexadecimal) format:</p>
              <p><code>
                const COLOR_RED = "#F00"; <br>
                const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0"; <br>
                const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F"; <br>
                const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00"; <br>
                // ...when we need to pick a color <br>
                let color = COLOR_ORANGE;<br>
                alert(color); // #FF7F00
              </code></p>
              <h5>Benefits</h5>
              <p><ul>
                <li>COLOR_ORANGE is much easier to remember than "#FF7F00".</li>
                <li>It is much easier to mistype "#FF7F00" than COLOR_ORANGE.</li>
                <li>When reading the code, COLOR_ORANGE is much more meaningful than #FF7F00.
                </li>
              </ul></p>
              <p>When should we use capitals for a constant and when should we name it normally? Let's make that clear.</p>
              <p>Being a “constant” just means that a variable's value never changes. But there are constants that are
                 known prior to execution (like a hexadecimal value for red) and there are constants that are calculated 
                 in run-time, during the execution, but do not change after their initial assignment.
              </p>
              <p>For instance:</p><br>
              <code>const pageLoadTime = /* time taken by a webpage to load */;</code><br>
              <p>The value of pageLoadTime is not known prior to the page load, so it's named normally. But it's still a
                 constant because it doesn't change after assignment.
                 In other words, capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.
              </p>
              <p>Some good rules to follow when dealing with variables are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart.</li>
                <li>Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, c, unless you really know what you're doing.</li>
                <li>Make names maximally descriptive and concise. </li>
              </ul>
